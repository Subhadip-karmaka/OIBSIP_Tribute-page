                <h2>About the Legend</h2>
                <p class="tribute-intro">Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam, popularly known as A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, was an Indian aerospace scientist and statesman who served as the 11th President of India from 2002 to 2007. He was born and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, and studied physics and aerospace engineering. He spent the next four decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO).</p>
                
                <p>Dr. Kalam was intimately involved in India's civilian space program and military missile development efforts. He thus came to be known as the <strong>"Missile Man of India"</strong> for his work on the development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology. He also played a pivotal organizational, technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.</p>
                
                <div class="highlight">
                    <p>Dr. Kalam was a recipient of several prestigious awards, including the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honour. He was a beloved figure, especially among students and youth, often referred to as the "People's President" for his humble and accessible nature.</p>
